In order to display the content of the generated notebook (as a json file), follow these steps:

- Go into a terminal
- Execute this command `docker exec -it splc-application sh`
- you will see a prompt like this `/code # `
- you can now execute classic shell commands
- So if you use `ls` you will be able to see the container file system
- The output of this command is:
  - app/
  - static/
  - requirements.txt
  - hello_world.ipynb (if you have generated the notebook)
- To display the content as a json file, execute the command `cat hello_world.ipynb`
- You can look for the "cells" key that is a list of all cells composing the document
- execute `exit` to quit the container shell
